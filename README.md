# React Stopwatch

## Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo
- Once you have the app locally, install necessary dependencies with `$ npm install`
- Start the development server locally with `$ npm start`, then visit `localhost:3000` in the browser to view app

##Build a Stopwatch component that:
- Allows the user to press a button "Start" to start the stopwatch
- While the stopwatch is started, the incrementing time should be displayed
- Allows the user to press a button "Pause" to pause the stopwatch at the current time
- Re-clicking the "Pause" button should resume the stopwatch
- Allows the user to press a button "Reset" to stop the stopwatch and reset the time to 0

##Bonus:
- When the stopwatch is at 0, the display time should be a different style
- When the user first visits the page, the only button that should be active is "Start"
- The other buttons should be unlocked only after the user clicks "start"
