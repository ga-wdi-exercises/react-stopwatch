# React Stopwatch

Recreate a stopwatch in React. Your final product should function similarly to [this deployed version](http://scary-religion.surge.sh/) of the component.

## Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo
- Once you have the app locally, install necessary dependencies with `$ npm install`
- Start the development server locally with `$ npm start`, then visit `localhost:3000` in the browser to view app

## Instructions


Take the existing markup rendered from the `Stopwatch` component in `src/Stopwatch.js` and change into a fully functioning component. This means that you only have to add functionality -- not markup or styling -- to the existing code! You will need to add a state and then alter the state using separate functions corresponding with their respective buttons. 

You may want to look at time functions in order to increase the time on the stop watch: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp
